# Disclaimer
Due to the fact that riot forces vanguard and LoL will probably stop working on Linux, this project has lost its meaning for me, I leave here my protests against riot. This implies that the server that provided the runes has been deactivated and the project will no longer work, thank you to everyone who used the program.

# Rune Maker
Hello, welcome to Rune Maker github page. Rune Maker is a League of Legends assistant
to select your runes (and in the future, your builds) automatically. I developed this app for personal use because in Linux this is inexistent. 
So, if you use Linux this app is made for you.
