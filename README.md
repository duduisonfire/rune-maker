# Rune Maker
Hello, welcome to Rune Maker github page. Rune maker is an League of Legends assistant
to select your runes (and in the future, your builds) automatically. I developed this app
to personal use, why in linux this app like are inexistent. So, if you use linux you are
welcome to use my app.
